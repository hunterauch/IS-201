        <li>Reason 1 for why it is bad to be obese</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased Risk of Chronic Diseases: Obesity is a major risk factor for a range of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and some cancers. The more obese a person is, the higher their risk of developing these conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Reason 2 for why it is bad to be obese</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced Quality of Life: Obese individuals may experience a reduced quality of life due to physical limitations, decreased mobility, and social stigma. They may also have trouble performing daily activities, such as walking up stairs or playing with their children.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Reason 3 for why it is bad to be obese</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Shorter Life Expectancy: Obesity is associated with a higher risk of premature death. The excess weight puts extra stress on the body's organs, including the heart, lungs, and liver, which can lead to the development of life-threatening conditions. Additionally, obesity is linked to a higher risk of complications during surgery and other medical procedures.
